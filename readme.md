## Captivation Developer Challenge

### To Run this Project from the linux cmd (Make sure Node and NPM are installed)
1. git clone this branch
2. npm install (shouldn't really need to)
3. Supply a text file (Remember the name)
    * Drag and drop the file into the project directory
4. In index.js change the filename variable to -> './{filename}.txt'
    * Make sure to include the ./ in front of the filename 
5. Run the app using `node index.js`
### To run via Docker (with my test txt)
1. Make sure docker is running
2. Run `docker run developerwakeling/codingchallenge:solution`
    * This just runs a basic test file that I have created
